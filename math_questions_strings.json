s unpack this step by step
this question tests your understanding of *laws of indices*, a core skill in SSCE Mathematics. First, ask yourself: *Can I write all numbers with the same base?* Yes! 3, 9, and 27 are all powers of 3: 9 = 3
 and 27 = 3
. This is crucial
when bases match, we can confidently apply index rules. So rewrite each term: \n\n
 \\(3^{-1}\\) stays as is.\n
 \\(9^{1/2} = (3^2)^{1/2} = 3^{2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 3^1 = 3\\) *(power-of-a-power rule: \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\))*\n
 \\(27^{-1/3} = (3^3)^{-1/3} = 3^{-1}\\) *(same rule)*\n\nNow substitute: numerator = \\(3^{-1} \\times 3^1 = 3^{-1 + 1} = 3^0 = 1\\) *(when multiplying same bases, **add** exponents)*\nDenominator = \\(3^{-1}\\)\nSo entire expression = \\(1 \\div 3^{-1} = 1 \\times 3^1 = 3\\) *(dividing powers: \\(a^m \\div a^n = a^{m-n}\\); here, \\(3^0 \\div 3^{-1} = 3^{1}\\))*\n\n
 **Teacher
s Tip**: Always reduce to a common base *before* calculating. A common mistake is to compute \\(9^{1/2} = 3\\) but forget to convert 27 similarly
then you get stuck mixing numbers. WAEC rewards clean, logical index manipulation. Answer: **3**."

s how to convert *any* base

      "explanation": "Geometric Progressions (G.P.) have a *constant ratio* \\(r\\) between consecutive terms: \\(T_n = ar^{n-1}\\), where \\(a\\) = first term. Here
s the smart way
no need to find \\(a\\)!\n\nGiven:\n- \\(T_4 = ar^3 = 54\\)\n- \\(T_6 = ar^5 = 486\\)\n\nDivide the two equations (this eliminates \\(a\\)):\n\\[\n\\frac{ar^5}{ar^3} = \\frac{486}{54} \\Rightarrow r^2 = 9 \\Rightarrow r = \\pm 3\n\\]\n\nNow, examine the terms: 54 and 486 are *both positive*, so the ratio must be positive (if \\(r = -3\\), terms would alternate sign: +, 
, +, 
). Thus, \\(r = 3\\).\n\n
 **Why division works**: In G.P., \\(\\frac{T_{n+k}}{T_n} = r^k\\). Here, from term 4 to 6 is 2 steps, so \\(r^2 = 486/54 = 9\\). This is faster than solving two equations.\n\n
 **WAEC insight**: Distractors like \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) come from inverting the ratio (\\(54/486 = 1/9\\)). Always ask: *Is the sequence increasing or decreasing?* 54 
 486 is increasing, so \\(r > 1\\). Final answer: **3**."

 Move the decimal point *right* until you get a number between 1 and 10: 0.000465 
 4.65 (moved 4 places)\n2
 Since you moved *right*, the exponent is *negative*: \\(n = -4\\)\n3
 So: \\(0.000465 = 4.65 \\times 10^{-4}\\)\n\n
 **Verify**: \\(4.65 \\times 10^{-4} = 4.65 \\div 10{,}000 = 0.000465\\)

BAC = angle in alternate segment = angle subtended by BC in opposite segment =

ABC is at B, between AB (tangent) and BC (chord).\n\nCorrect logic:\n- AB tangent
