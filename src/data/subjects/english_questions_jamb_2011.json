      "text": "In 1962, a team of scientists produce a special radio station that had a range of fifteen miles. Even though communication was being accomplished in space at a range of more than a million times this distance, the new radio station caused much excitement among scientist.\n\nThe reason: its power supply was a 'battery' made of bacteria. For the first time, practical amounts of electricity were being produced by a form of life and put to use. Bio cell, the fully biological battery, was born.\n\nThe battery was a breakthrough because it used natural processes in living cells to produce electrical energy. The scientists discovered that certain bacteria, when fed sugar, released electrons as a by-product of their metabolism. These electrons could be captured and channeled to generate a current.\n\nAlthough the power output was small, it was enough to operate low-energy devices like the radio transmitter. The implications were enormous: clean, renewable energy from living organisms. Researchers envisioned future applications in medical implants, environmental sensors, and remote monitoring systems — all powered by microbes.\n\nChallenges remained: scaling up the technology, ensuring long-term stability, and increasing efficiency. But the principle was proven: life itself could be harnessed as a power source.\n2011 JAMB Use of English, Passage I"

      "text": "The mind is a mysterious thing. It is the seat of thought, emotion, and will. What a man thinks determines what he becomes. Thoughts are the seeds of action. Good thoughts lead to good actions; bad thoughts lead to bad actions. Evil thoughts, if harboured and nurtured, eventually manifest in evil deeds.\n\nIt is therefore important to guard the mind. One must be careful about the kind of thoughts one allows to dwell in the mind. The company one keeps, the books one reads, the programmes one watches — all these influence the mind.\n\nA polluted mind produces polluted behaviour. Just as dirty water cannot produce clean ice, so an impure mind cannot produce wholesome conduct. Hence, the need for mental purification.\n\nPurification begins with awareness. One must become conscious of one’s thought patterns and learn to reject harmful or destructive ideas. Meditation, reflection, and positive affirmations can help in this process. Over time, the mind becomes a fertile ground for virtue and wisdom.\n2011 JAMB Use of English, Passage II"

      "text": "Though assumption is the lowest level of knowledge; it is still a form of knowledge, and knowledge is key. Assumptions are the foundation upon which interpretation and conclusion are built.\n\nEverything in life operate under certain assumptions. We make management decisions based on the assumptions we hold about how management ought to function and how people ought to be governed.\n\nFor some of us, we consciously imbibe assumptions and principles about life and consciously decide based on them; for others, it is unconsciously but potent all the same. Our assumptions will either drown us or help us soar through life.\n\nWe have always seen life as an immense mansion with many rooms. Some rooms lead to wealth, others to the opposite. Ultimately, we decide where we end up; and life, thus far, has proved that not everyone of us decides well, we all behave differently where we have different levels of understanding, and behave the way where our understanding is the same.\n\nWe eat because we all understand the consequences of not eating. We all wear clothes because each of us comprehends lunacy. The list goes on and on. It is inevitable that some of us will make choices that get and keep us on the lower rung of the ladder by reason of exposure, training or some others variables.\n\nLife is about role playing. We choose our roles wisely or foolishly, consciously or unconsciously. Some of us get wiser to new levels of self-awareness enough to redefine our roles, others make no effort to build further capacity and therefore remain where they are. It is based on those realities that we draw the conclusion that not everyone will be wealthy in life. We lead, inspire and motivate people to strive and succeed.\n\nIt is also important that we paint the full and true picture of life so that we can discourage vain pursuits. Balance must be enthroned as a critical component of truth, and people know, for instance, that 'the top' is not a place that all must ascend.\n\nOur greatest consolation lies in our deep conviction that true prosperity is in fulfilment through hard work than in intangible acquisition. There are set roles that some of us have been wired up to play in life but which we are not content enough to play because society esteems such roles to be inferior.\n2011 JAMB Use of English, Passage III"
