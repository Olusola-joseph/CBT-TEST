      "text": "Returning home after a decade and half abroad, our Geography master remained incurably addicted to foreign ways and ideas for years after landing here. He would forever stick to his theory of Africans suffering from a curse inflicted on them by the Almighty God for some heinous sins committed centuries ago. He would, in support of this theory, ask listeners:\n\n\"Why would our mosquito inflict deadly malaria on us whereas the British mosquito does not bite? Why aren't there poisonous snakes in Britain whereas here most snakes are deadly?\n\nWhy should the deadly sickle cell disease be peculiar to the black race?\"\n\nOf course, he hardly waits for answers to these and similar questions before jumping to the same inevitable conclusion. However, he met his match one day when a new student joined the class and heard the litany we were used to. The new boy calmly said, \"Sir, I happen to know a few white men who suffer from the sickle cell disease; some are Italians and some are Spanish. The mosquito is equally deadly in India, South-east Asian countries and South America. The United States and some other South American countries have their deadly snakes. And, Sir, I know many white men, some of them British, who would prefer our brilliant sunshine to their horribly cold winter.\" And he sat down.\n\nI had never, before that day, seen our master so consumed with anger. He directed a burning look at the poor boy, who had no answer to this new battle. Without as much as saying a single word, the master stalked out of the classroom. Needless to say, our anger was turned on the new boy, who had decided to rock the boat without taking the time to sound the water. A delegation was sent to the master to apologise to him.\n\nHe was appeased. But we all noticed something rather unusual thereafter: never again did he dwell on the issue of Africans being the cursed people."

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The passage tells us that the master \"would forever stick to his theory of Africans suffering from a curse inflicted on them by the Almighty God for some heinous sins committed centuries ago.\" That is exactly the idea in option C.

      "explanation": "The master asks, \"Why would our mosquito inflict deadly malaria on us whereas the British mosquito does not bite?\" and \"Why aren't there poisonous snakes in Britain whereas here most snakes are deadly?\" He also claims sickle‑cell disease is peculiar to the black race. So A, C and D echo his claims. He never says malaria occurs in both Africa and Britain; that is actually the opposite of his point. Hence B is the argument he **did not** use."

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The narrator says the new boy \"decided to rock the boat\", meaning he disturbed a settled situation by challenging the master's views. No actual boat is involved; the class situation is compared *implicitly* to a boat without using \"like\" or \"as\". This is a metaphor. A simile would require 'like/as', personification gives human qualities to non‑humans, and hyperbole exaggerates for effect."

Then he adds, \"And, Sir, I know many white men, some of them British, who would prefer our brilliant sunshine to their horribly cold winter.\" This extra argument (D) undermines the master's belief that Africa is uniquely cursed and undesirable."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The master, \"consumed with anger\", fixes the boy with a \"burning look\" and stalks out of the room without speaking. This behaviour suggests that he cannot refute the boy logically and is reacting emotionally instead. That implies he recognises the strength of the boy's arguments (A). D is partly true—he is dogmatic—but the specific reason for the silent anger is that the new arguments have effectively challenged him."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The phrase \"who had no answer to this new battle\" begins with the relative pronoun *who* and gives extra information about \"the poor boy\". It is not essential for the basic structure of the sentence and is set off by commas in standard punctuation. That makes it a non‑defining (non‑restrictive) relative clause. All relative clauses are subordinate, but the question asks for the specific grammatical name, which is option A."

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "We normally speak of \"viral and bacterial diseases\". Here \"many virus\" (viruses) are one category; the other category of diseases should be 'bacterial'. 'Germ' is a general word, and 'dirty' or 'mosquito' do not classify types of diseases."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The passage later refers to the \"... cold\". The everyday name for a mild nasal and throat infection—the common cold—is also 'catarrh'. 'Runny‑nose' is a symptom, not the disease name; 'influenza' is flu, a more serious viral infection."

      "explanation": "The statement is about how the measles virus behaves over long periods. It says it can remain in the same state for centuries. The best word for that is \"unchanged\". 'Constant' is close in meaning but less natural here; 'undiscovered' speaks about our knowledge, not the virus itself, and 'erratic' means irregular—the opposite of the idea."

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "To \"underscore\" literally means to underline; figuratively it means to **emphasize** or give special importance to something. Hence C is correct. 'Justifies' means shows something is right; 'clarifies' means makes clearer; 'summarizes' means gives a brief account—related but distinct ideas."

Ignoble means base, mean, or lacking in honour. \"Dishonourable\" (D) matches this meaning. 'Embarrassing' focuses on shame for the observer, 'extraordinary' on unusualness, and 'honourable' is the opposite."
