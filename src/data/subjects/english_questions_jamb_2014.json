      "text": "Political change and social transformation in the form of revolutions have radically altered the course of human civilization and history.\n\nToday, the world is witnessing political and social changes arising from the desire of people all over the globe for greater freedom and a voice in the way they are governed and a better standard of living. Part of these struggles and processes have become more pronounced in the third world since the end of the east west cold war in the late 1980s, and in the face of the challenges being posed by the ongoing process of globalization.\n\nWhile political and social changes may appear to be distinct phenomena, they are analytically inseparable. Political and social changes refer to alteration or transformations in human behaviour, norms and polito-social institutions. Such changes are often a collective response to the need to change, or as a tacit recognition of a shift in the prevalent power relations in the society. Therefore, the coming to power of new sets of rulers, or the establishment of new structures and processes of governance broadly typifies socio-political changes.\n\nIt is important to note that change can either be positive or negative. In most cases, political and social changes are caused by certain factors or reasons. These push people to collectively organize themselves to struggle for a change in the existing power relations.\n\nAnother reason is to capture political power, in the hope of making life better for the generality of the people. If politics is defined as who gets what, when and how; it implies that political change refers to an alteration in the form of power, and the identity of the group or class which controls and wields state power\n\nAdapted from Anifowose, R. and Enemuo, F. (1999) Element of politics."

      "text": "Like all reptiles, snakes are cold-blooded, or more correctly, ectodermic- they cannot produce their own body heat; instead, they rely on the sun to heat their bodies. Because they do not rely on energy from food to generate body heat; snakes can survive on an extremely meagre diet. Some wait for months between successive meals and a few survive by eating a large meal just once or twice a year. When they do eat, snakes swallow their prey whole rather than biting off small pieces.\n\nMany snakes have specialized jaws that enable them to swallow animals that are far larger than their own heads. Although uncommon, some snakes, such as the African rock python, have been observed eating animals as large as an antelope or a small cow.\n\nWith over two thousand five hundred species belonging to more than ten families, snakes are large and successful group. They owe much of this success to their versatility snakes occupy habitat ranging from underground burrows to the top of the tree, to ocean depths as great as one hundred and fifty meters. They are found on every continent except Antarctica , and although they are most abundant in tropical areas, many survive in regions marked by extreme cold.\n\nThe only places without snakes are parts of the Polar Regions and isolated islands, such as the republic of Ireland and New-Zealand as opposed to places in Nigeria like plateau and Gombe states in the northern parts where there is a large population of snakes."
