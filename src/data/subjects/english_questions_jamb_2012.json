      "text": "Religion in its various forms is very strong in Nigeria. In other words, Nigerian people are very religious. Most of them believe that there is an unseen supernatural world, apart from the natural world we see around us.\n\nThis other world is inhabited by beings who are the source of our knowledge of good and evil. They watch and judge us and if we offend them they may have to be appeased with prayers and sacrifices.\n\nCertain individuals in the natural world — priest, prophets and diviners — are believed to be endowed with special powers to make contact with the other world. These individuals lay down ceremonies or rituals which must be observed if due honour is to be paid to the unseen beings.\n\nThe religious beliefs and practices of Nigerians can be classified under three main headings: Traditional religion, Islam and Christianity. In this passage, our focus is on Traditional Religion.\n\nTraditional or indigenous religion continues to exert a strong influence on many people's mind partly because of its association with their birth places and families. Each ethnic group has its own religious traditions, and these are often linked to some sacred spots in the ethnic homeland. Yet the various traditional religions have much in common: a remote but benevolent high god; under him, a number of lesser gods who interact with mankind; and below them again, and closest to living men and women, the spirits of the ancestors.\n\nIn Yoruba tradition, for example, there are more than 400 lesser deities presided over by the high god, Olorun. Because he is remote from mankind, shrines are not built to him and worship is not offered to him directly. The lesser gods, on the other hand, are the subject of special cults, each with its own priest and devotees.\n\nEshu, the messenger of the Gods; Ifa, the god of divination; Shango, the god of thunder, and so on. Traditional religion was also strong in other parts of Nigeria.\n\nIn Igbo Traditional religion, there were fewer gods. Although there was a remote high god, the most important figure was Ala or Ani, the goddess of the earth.\n\nIn Hausa land, traditional religion has largely gone underground owing to the influence of Islam, but belief in the existence of 'Bori' spirits and their power to possess people, especially women, is strong in some areas. Each spirit is associated with certain type of behaviour, which is manifested by the possessed individual.\n\nDivination — the discovery of what is unknown or is yet to happen by supernatural or magical means — is an important element of traditional religion. It is often one of the function of ‘medicine men’ or ‘herbalists’. In Igboland, there also used to be several oracles which people consulted in order to seek solutions to their problems.\n\nWith the coming of Christianity, their influence has however waned, but in areas like Arochukwu and Okija, the influence of such oracles is still strongly felt.\n\n(Adapted from Grant, Nnamonu and Jowitt (1997), Senior English Project: For Senior Secondary School Students)"

      "text": "Recently, literally research reveals that Nigerians hardly have time to read. In essence, the reading culture in Nigeria is now at a low ebb. It is disturbing, however, that the few Nigerians that read concentrates on foreign books than indigenous productions. Most Nigerian authors of novels, storybooks, fiction and non-fiction series have decried, on different occasions, their woes.\n\nThey were bitter in the way most owners of bookshops and publishers treat them. It was gathered that most renowned bookshops in Nigeria hardly sell books written by indigenous authors. They preferred to stock foreign books.\n\nWhen contacted by DAILY INDEPENDENT, the general manager of popular bookstore in Lagos Island declared that most of the bookshops preferred to stock foreign books because of higher demands for them, the question that bothers most Nigerian authors is, while their overseas counterparts are being rewarded with great international honours, why are Nigerians not according them such recognition in their own country?\n\nRecently, Nigerian novelist, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie won the 2007 Orange Prize Award for the literary world’s top award for fiction in English written by women. The award carries a prize tag of $30,000. It was reported in Publishers Weekly, Half of a Yellow Sun, the book that earned her the award, was profoundly gripping. According to the reviewer, the book is a ‘transcendent novel of many descriptive triumph, most notably its diction of the impact of war brutalities on peasant and intellectuals alike. It is a searing history in fictional form, intensely evocative and immensely absorbing’.\n\nChinua Achebe, ‘Father of Modern African Literature’, also won the second ever Man Booker international Prize of £60,000 with his first novel Things Fall Apart, published in 1958.\n\nWhen Professor Wole Soyinka won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986, the fame confirmed the relevance of Nigerians in the world of classical excellence. Ben Okri won the 1991 Booker Prize with his work, The Famished Road, and the world celebrated Nigeria as the giant of Africa. It was also gathered that most of the publishers hurriedly produce books and in the process marred their good contents. Most of the books are not properly edited and actually become substandard when compared with the foreign products. The extent to which book publishing standard has fallen in Nigerian is alarming.\n\nOften Nigerian publishers have been blamed for this. It is instructive that none of the books mentioned had been published in Nigerian. It was discovered that most students in tertiary institutions depends on dictations from their lecturers and/or handouts. A science lecturer in one of the Nigerian universities, who had been a victim of handout sales scandal, told DAILY INDEPENDENT the reality of campus challenges in relation to books. ‘I was to dictate notes slowly to students who hung on every word in the absence of textbooks in a library that had, to all intent and purpose, stopped buying new books when the local currency devalued. But what other alternative does one have?’\n\n(Adapted from DAILY INDEPENDENT, Monday, 20 August, 2007)"

      "text": "It is said that experience is the best teacher. This is true to a large extent because the lessons we learn from experience tend to be permanent. There is usually an emotional attachment to such lessons which helps in retaining them. When, for instance, a child touches a hot object and gets burnt, he never forgets the experience. Henceforth, he becomes cautious whenever he comes across anything that looks hot."
