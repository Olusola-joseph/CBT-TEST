      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "This is a standard administrative question appearing at the start of JAMB Use of English papers. Though not derived from Passage I content, it is conventionally grouped under Passage I for formatting. The correct answer (Type B) is printed on the actual exam paper header — a fixed detail in the real test. Students are expected to verify their paper type physically. Option C is correct because the question tests attentiveness to instructions, a subtle but critical exam skill. Distractors (A, B, D) mimic plausible alphabet codes but are fabricated; only C matches authentic JAMB coding for this paper set."

      "options": [
        { "id": "A", "text": "Anyone, with almost no training, can run pots on a wheel." },
        { "id": "B", "text": "Pots can be made quickly and correctly." },

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The passage explicitly states: *'In this way, a small and medium-sized pot can be made more quickly and accurately.'* This is a direct factual claim supporting option B. Let’s evaluate all options: A is incorrect because the passage implies skill is required (e.g., centering the clay, drawing walls uniformly); no mention of 'almost no training'. C is speculative — while wheel-thrown pots may be more uniform, durability isn’t discussed; the word 'break' never appears. D is contradicted by the description of effortful steps: weighing, centering, shaping, trimming — indicating hard work. B is verbatim-supported, making it the only objectively correct inference. This tests precise reading comprehension — students must avoid over-interpretation."

      "question": "From the passage, how does a potter make several pots of almost identical size?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "A", "text": "By having the knowledge of different pots." },
        { "id": "B", "text": "By weighing the lumps of clay." },

        { "id": "D", "text": "By knowing what to do from experience." }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The text says: *'They are weighed out so that each pot will be roughly the same size; for example, for making pint-sized jugs, the lumps of clay will be one and a half kilogrammes.'* This is a clear, methodical procedure — quantitative control via mass measurement. Option B is thus textually explicit. A is vague and unsupported; 'knowledge of different pots' relates to design, not size uniformity. C ('right tools') is partially true (wheel, rib, etc. are listed), but tools alone don’t ensure size consistency — only weighing does. D appeals to tacit knowledge, but the passage prioritizes measurable technique over intuition. This question assesses ability to identify *procedural specificity* — a key skill in technical texts."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "‘Trim’ is a standard verb in ceramics and manufacturing, meaning *to remove superfluous material to refine shape or size*. The context: after shaping the pot, excess clay remains — this must be removed for precision. Option A captures this precisely: 'cut away unnecessary parts' = excision of surplus. B is a misreading of an earlier step (*'force the lump to the centre'*). C and D are fabrications: 'day' is a typo for 'clay' in some prints, but even so, 'divide the clay' and 'wash colours' aren’t mentioned. Lexically, *trim* derives from Old English *trymman* (to make firm, arrange), evolving to mean *neaten by cutting*. This tests vocabulary-in-context — crucial for technical comprehension."

      "explanation": "The sentence reads: *'…a town where learners from many different parts can find a congenial temporary home…'* Here, *congenial* modifies 'home' and describes an environment conducive to comfort and sociability. Etymologically, from Latin *con-* (together) + *genialis* (genial, kindly), it means *pleasant because suited to one’s nature or tastes*. D ('nice') is the closest everyday synonym. A ('congested') is antithetical — implies overcrowding, discomfort. B ('precise') is technical, irrelevant to social harmony. C ('similar') misreads the root — *congenial* ≠ *congenital* or *congeneric*. In exam contexts, *congenial* frequently appears in descriptions of atmospheres (workplace, community), always positive. Distractors exploit phonetic similarity (A), lexical confusion (C), or category error (B)."

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The passage’s core argument is that musical response is *subjective*: *'Our response to a musical performance or an artiste is subjective and rooted in deep feelings… There is no one ‘Truth’ about what we hear and feel.'* This explicitly supports D: 'Music influences feelings at different levels' — meaning individualized, variable emotional impact. Let’s dismantle others: A is unsupported — 'evaluation performance' isn’t discussed; critics evaluate *music*, not other tasks. B is false — the text distinguishes *listeners* and *artistes*. C is directly contradicted: *'Even professional critics can differ strongly…'* — thus feelings are *not* objective. D is the only inference warranted by the central thesis: music’s power lies in its *affective diversity*. This tests thematic synthesis — moving beyond details to overarching claims."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The full phrase is: *'feelings are exchanged between stage and hall'*. In performance terminology, 'stage' universally refers to the area where performers (artistes) present, while 'hall' denotes the auditorium where the audience sits. This binary — *performer ↔ spectator* — is foundational in theatre/music studies. Option B captures this dyad exactly. A conflates person and product (music ≠ stage). C and D introduce irrelevant agents (producer, director) unmentioned in the passage. This exemplifies *metonymy*: using physical spaces to represent social roles. Recognizing conventional stage-hall symbolism is essential for interpreting performing arts discourse."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The key evidence is: *'People listen to music in many different ways. For instance, music can be a barely perceived background as in a film or a totally absorbing experience as in a concert.'* This shows appreciation is *context-dependent* — ambient in films, immersive in concerts. Hence A is correct: environment (film vs. concert hall) dictates mode of appreciation. B is refuted — no comparison of individual vs. group listening. C is unsupported; emotional state isn’t discussed as a variable. D is contradicted: *'Even professional critics can differ strongly…'* — implying no privileged access to 'better' appreciation. This tests *deductive reasoning*: identifying implications, not just explicit statements. The passage emphasizes *relativity* of musical experience — a postmodern aesthetic stance."

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The passage states: *'In a live performance artists put themselves on the line… feelings are exchanged between stage and hall.'* 'Put themselves on the line' implies vulnerability and risk; 'feelings are exchanged' denotes mutual influence — hallmark of *interaction*. Thus B is correct. A is partially true (live shows are staged), but 'stage-managed' emphasizes control, not excitement. C is false — live performances risk errors; 'error-free' contradicts 'put on the line'. D is not mentioned; education isn’t a theme. Interactivity is the *causal link* for 'special excitement' — the dynamic feedback loop between performer and audience generates unique energy. This reflects *performative theory*: meaning arises from co-creation in real time."

      "explanation": "The opening sentence is definitive: *'Music plays a vital role in human society. Good music provides entertainment and emotional release…'* 'Entertainment' = enjoyment; 'emotional release' = relief. A is verbatim. B is irrelevant — accessibility ≠ societal role. C overstates: live performance is *one* mode, not 'most popular'. D describes technology, not function; also, 'everybody' is hyperbolic (access inequality exists). The passage roots music’s value in *psychological benefit*, aligning with anthropological views (e.g., music as social cohesion tool). This tests *main idea identification* — recognizing thesis statements, especially in introductory paragraphs."

      "explanation": "The sentence establishes an *analogy*: H-bomb explosion ~ natural atmospheric disturbances. Meteorologists classify *events* (e.g., hurricanes, volcanic eruptions) — not abstract concepts. 'Occurrences' means *incidents or phenomena that happen*, fitting scientifically. A ('programmes') implies planned activities — bombs are not 'programmes'. C ('resources') suggests utility — irrelevant here. D ('laws') refers to principles, not events. Crucially, the next sentence confirms by listing *volcanic eruptions* — specific occurrences. This tests *semantic field matching*: selecting the noun that shares the category (natural phenomena) with the exemplar."

      "explanation": "The collocation *'volcanic eruption'* is a fixed scientific term — one of the most common in geophysics. While 'explosion' (D) is semantically related, it’s too general; volcanoes *erupt*, not merely explode (eruption includes ash plumes, lava flow, etc.). A ('insurrection') is political, metaphorical. C ('commotion') is vague, informal. Lexical precision matters: *eruption* specifically denotes *the sudden release of material from a volcano*.

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The phrase *'on this scale'* is a high-frequency academic collocation meaning *at this level of magnitude/size*. The context discusses massive events (H-bombs, volcanoes), implying *scale* of energy release. A–C are distractors exploiting similar /s/ sounds (*scanner, skate, snow*), but semantically irrelevant. *Scale* also fits the scientific register: meteorologists use *scales* (e.g., Richter, Fujita) to quantify events. This is a *register-appropriate collocation* question — testing awareness that technical writing favors precise, conventional phrasing over creative alternatives."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Physics of explosions: rapid expansion creates *shock waves*, which are *pressure waves* — longitudinal waves of compressed air. This is foundational in acoustics and seismology. B ('pressure volume') is oxymoronic — volume is extensive, pressure intensive. C ('pressure air') is ungrammatical noun stacking. D ('pressure gauge') is an instrument, not a phenomenon. The passage later confirms: *'into what is called… shock waves'* — synonymous with pressure waves. This tests *scientific literacy*: recognizing that real-world events map to technical concepts. Distractors misuse 'pressure' as a modifier incorrectly."

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The sentence describes the bomb’s action: *'The immediate result of the… is that the air surrounding the bomb is raised very rapidly to an enormously high…'* Only 'detonation' — the act of exploding — causes instantaneous energy release. A ('reduction') is opposite in meaning. B ('commotion') is too weak, colloquial. D ('distortion') refers to signal alteration, not initiation. *Detonation* is the precise term for supersonic explosive decomposition (vs. *deflagration*). In technical writing, *detonation* is the default for nuclear devices. This tests *domain-specific verb-noun collocation* — knowing which noun pairs with 'result' in causal chains."

A ('way') is spatial, irrelevant. C ('class') is sociological. D ('profile') could mean shape, but not 'high'. The passage’s next line — *'The hot gases expand…'* — confirms *temperature* as the antecedent: heat → expansion.

C ('fireworks') are celebratory, small-scale. D ('firesmokes') is nonstandard and emphasizes smoke, not the luminous sphere. Scientifically, fireballs result from blackbody radiation of hot gases.

The epithet uses *biblical allusion* (1 Samuel 17) to critique colonial mimicry: Samuel imitates European authority but lacks moral foundation. This tests *symbolic naming conventions* in African literature."

      "explanation": "Teacher Zaccheus’s house is the site of *moral confrontation* — where characters face unvarnished truth (*chi* = personal god/conscience). The phrase 'beheld your chi in stark nakedness' evokes *existential reckoning*, which Zaccheus engineers via Socratic questioning. B is correct. Others: Nwokike is corrupt, Okeke traditionalist, Laze peripheral. Zaccheus represents *critical consciousness* — his house is a *theatre of authenticity*. This tests *symbolic setting analysis*: locations as psychological spaces. Note: 'chi' is central to Igbo ontology; seeing it 'naked' means confronting one’s raw destiny."

The comparison underscores his *liminality*: he exploits tradition while rejecting its ethics. B is correct. A, D imply fluidity but lack supernatural connotation. C is Nwomiko’s role. Ike uses *spirit imagery* to critique *abnormal agency* — Samuel’s power is illegitimate because unanchored in community.
