      "text": "Anthropologists tell us that for a society to remain stable, the roles of men and women must be properly differentiated and well defined. In primitive societies, the men were assigned the roles of going out to hunt, fish and fight off the hostile tribe next door while the women did the housekeeping and minded the children. The men were believed to be superior to the women in physical strength and capability. There was a controversy in these societies as to what the roles of the sexes should be.\n\nConsequently, primitive societies enjoyed great stability. However, with the advancement of civilization, many of the special privileges traditionally enjoyed by men began to be eroded one after another. There is hardly any sphere of human endeavour in which women have not gained a firm foothold: there are women doctors, engineers, pilots, prime ministers, judges, bankers and so on.\n\nToday, the women's spheres of operation are no longer restricted to the home; she is successfully competing with her counterpart in every area of human activity. But has this development been an unqualified blessing to the society?\n\nTo answer this question, let us examine some of the problems created in the process of achieving women's emancipation. First, a large number of women including the married ones and mothers now take up paid employment. The conditions attached to such employment make it extremely difficult if not impossible for them to take adequate care of their children at home. Since no one serve two masters, the health and education of the children suffer tremendously.\n\nAdapted from Ukwuegbe C., et al (2006) CATCH‑Up English Language for SSCEMME, Ibadan: Heinemann Educational Books (Nigeria) PLC."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The passage says that with the advancement of civilization, many special privileges of men \"began to be eroded\". *Eroded* means gradually worn away or reduced. Option C (“dwindle with the advancement of civilization”) restates that idea directly. Option B mentions women emancipation specifically; the passage actually links the erosion more generally to advancing civilization, not only to emancipation as a movement."

        { "id": "D", "text": "The office and the home" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The passage explains that many women, including mothers, now take up paid employment, making it difficult to care for their children at home. It then uses the proverb \"no one serve two masters\", referring to the conflicting demands of **paid work (office)** and **home responsibilities**. So they are trying to serve the office and the home. The other options focus on people (husband, children) or aspects (health, education) rather than the two spheres of duty."

        { "id": "D", "text": "the roles of women were commonly interpreted" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The first sentence states that for stability, the roles of men and women must be \"properly differentiated and well defined\". It adds that primitive societies \"enjoyed great stability\". The clear reason is that the tasks of men and women were clearly outlined and differentiated, not the mere superiority or inferiority of one sex. Thus B captures the principle that clearly defined roles promoted social stability."

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The author notes that many women now take paid employment and that the conditions of such jobs make it nearly impossible for them to care adequately for their children; as a result, \"the health and education of the children suffer tremendously.\" This describes domestic problems or crises in the home. The passage does not explicitly mention resentment of men (B), female ambition as such (A), or changes in men’s attitudes (D)."

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Here, the children's health and education \"suffer tremendously\" because their mothers cannot give them enough attention. To \"suffer\" in such a context means to be adversely or badly affected. Option D expresses this core meaning. Option A is close, but 'disadvantaged' usually refers to social or economic position rather than immediate harm. Options B and C do not directly reflect the extent of damage implied by \"tremendously\"."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The standard collocation is \"infrastructural **development**\". Realistic planning must go hand in hand with the development of infrastructure. 'Projected' and 'arrangement' do not fit grammatically in this noun slot, and 'tenet' (principle) is conceptually wrong."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Governments make \"budgetary provisions\" for various sectors. The sentence is about planning public expenditure, so \"budgetary provisions\" is the natural phrase. 'Planning provisions' or 'projected provisions' are not standard expressions."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "In budgeting, planners prepare **estimates** of how much different projects will cost. So infrastructural *estimates* should be embedded in the budget. 'Prompt' is an adjective/adverb, and 'processes' does not collocate with 'budgetary provisions' in the intended sense."

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "If infrastructural items are \"glaringly **omitted**\" from the budget, they are left out altogether. That omission undermines development. \"Shortened\" or \"altered\" do not convey absence, and \"cleared\" has an unrelated meaning here."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "\"Impaired\" means weakened or damaged, which is exactly what happens to national development when infrastructure is omitted. 'Degraded' often suggests moral or environmental decline, and 'reduced' is too weak and general. 'Denied' would mean no development at all, which overstates the case."

      "explanation": "The point is that some *sectors* (like politics, consumption, etc.) are favoured above infrastructure. So \"sectorial interests\"—interests of particular sectors—is appropriate. 'Sectional' usually refers to regions or factions; 'selectional' is not a standard word; 'palliative' means soothing but not solving a problem."

      "explanation": "Neglecting infrastructure keeps an economy from growing, which is \"economic stagnation\"—little or no growth. A 'recession' is a temporary downturn, not necessarily a prolonged state. 'Social decay' shifts the focus to morals rather than infrastructure, and 'management' is not a negative state."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "To \"not mind\" something means to have no objection to it. So the statement means that the person (here, the government official) was not annoyed or displeased when his name was mentioned. Option A expresses that clearly; B and C are the opposite, and D changes the subject."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "\"But for\" means \"if it were not for\". So \"But for the expense\" means \"if it were not so expensive\". Option D rephrases this conditional idea directly. Option B is negative but lacks the conditional sense of desire; C mentions 'if I had more money' rather than focusing on the car's being expensive."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The structure \"No sooner had X happened than Y happened\" means Y occurred **immediately after** X. So the correct interpretation is that the phone rang just after he got into the pool. Option C ('as he was getting into') suggests simultaneity rather than sequence; A and D contradict the original statement."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The idiom \"might just as well\" suggests that, given the circumstances, there is no better alternative; if you do the suggested thing you lose nothing. So the father is effectively saying the speaker has little choice but to stay at home. Option A captures this inevitability. Options C and D add a reason ('best thing', 'in order to do well') not stated in the sentence."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The word *distribution* has four syllables: dis‑tri‑BU‑tion. In standard pronunciation /ˌdɪstrɪˈbjuːʃn/, the main stress falls on the third syllable *BU*. Option A correctly marks this (**distriBUtion**). Option B wrongly stresses the first syllable, C the second, while D does not mark any stress clearly. A general rule: many -tion/-sion nouns place stress two syllables before the ending (dis‑tri‑**BU**‑tion)."

      "explanation": "*Irrevocable* has five syllables: i‑RRE‑vo‑ca‑ble. The stress is on the second syllable /ɪˈrevəkəbl/. Option C (**iRREvocable**) shows this. Option A stresses the third syllable (VO), D the last (BLE), and B is simply a misspelling. A useful pattern: for many words with prefixes like *ir‑, im‑, in‑*, the stress falls on the root, not on the prefix."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "In emphatic‑stress questions, the capitalised word corrects a wrong assumption in the question. The stress is on **ACROSS**, so the incorrect element in the question must be a *different* place preposition.\n\nQuestion (C) – *\"Is my house **on** the road?\"* – assumes the house is on the road itself. A suitable corrective answer is: *\"No, my house is **ACROSS** the road.\"* That contrast (on ↔ across) explains the emphasis. Options (A) and (B) change the subject or object, and (D) already uses „across‟, so there is nothing for the emphatic stress on ACROSS to correct."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The stressed word is **AT**, so the incorrect element in the question must be some *other* time expression. Question (A) – *\"Does the shop close **by** 4pm?\"* – contrasts \"by\" (any time up to 4 p.m.) with \"at\" (exactly 4 p.m.). The emphatic answer, *\"No, the shop closes **AT** 4 p.m.\"*, corrects that wrong preposition, which justifies the stress.\n\nOptions (B), (C) and (D) all already contain *at 4pm* or raise different issues (subject, article) instead of the preposition of time, so the emphatic stress on **AT** would not make sense with them."
