Inside is a box “FACTORS OF PRODUCTION” with arrows showing real flows of factor services from households to firms and money flows of factor payments in the opposite direction. One of the money‑flow arrows is labelled **Y**. The lower half of the diagram shows all money flows; the upper half shows real flows."
