      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",

      "correctAnswer": "E",
      "explanation": "The profit‑maximizing condition for any firm, including a monopoly, is **MC = MR**. Minimum ATC (A) yields productive efficiency but not necessarily maximum profit, and maximizing sales or output can reduce profit."
