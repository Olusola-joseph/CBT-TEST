      "explanation": "Economics views production as a means to **satisfy human wants** by providing goods and services. Profit, jobs and wealth are important, but they are secondary to this fundamental objective."

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "All the other factors (training, job attractiveness, unions, policy) affect wages **through their impact on the demand for and supply of labour**. Ultimately, wage differences are determined by demand‑and‑supply conditions in each labour market."

      "explanation": "A rightward (outward) shift of the PPF signifies an **increase in productive capacity**, which occurs with better technology, education, or more/better resources. Option C states this; A and B would shift the economy inside the PPF, not outward."

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The economically active population depends on how many people fall within working ages and participate in the labour force (affected by age structure, sex ratio, etc.). The **length of the working day** affects hours worked, not how many people are economically active."

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "A **rightward shift** of the entire supply curve (from S₀ to S₁) means sellers are willing to supply more at each price: an **increase in supply**. An increase in quantity supplied would be a movement along the same curve, not a shift."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "For **substitutes**, a rise in the price of Y causes an increase in demand for X, so quantity of X and price of Y move in the same direction. The cross elasticity is therefore **positive**. For complements it would be negative."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "A **maximum price** (price ceiling) set below equilibrium creates **excess demand** (shortage), not excess supply. Shortages often lead to queuing, hoarding, black markets, bribery and favouritism, so B–E are typical problems."

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "A monopolist maximizes profit where **MR = MC**, but the demand curve lies above the MR curve, so the price charged (on the demand curve) is **greater than MC**. In perfect competition price equals MC; in monopoly it exceeds MC."

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "When price falls, a good becomes relatively cheaper than substitutes (**substitution effect**) and, with a given money income, the consumer's **real income rises**, allowing more purchases. Together these effects explain the downward slope of the demand curve."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "E",
      "explanation": "Imperfect competition (e.g. monopolistic competition, oligopoly) is characterized by firms having some price‑setting power because their products are **differentiated** rather than identical. In perfect competition, products are homogeneous and each firm faces a horizontal demand curve at the market price."
