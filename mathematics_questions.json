      "explanation": "This problem involves calculating the area of a rectangle using the formula Area = length × width: Area = 8cm × 5cm = 40cm². The units become cm² (square centimeters) because we're multiplying two measurements that are in centimeters. The fundamental principle is that area measures the space inside a shape."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "This problem demonstrates the fundamental principles of solving linear equations. To solve for x in the equation 2x + 5 = 15, we need to isolate x. First, we subtract 5 from both sides: 2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5, which gives us 2x = 10. Then, we divide both sides by 2: 2x ÷ 2 = 10 ÷ 2, which gives us x = 5. The fundamental principle in solving equations is maintaining equality - whatever operation you perform on one side of the equation, you must perform on the other side as well. This ensures the equation remains balanced."

          "text": "30cm"
        }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This problem involves calculating the perimeter of a square, which is a fundamental concept in geometry. The perimeter is the total distance around the outside of a shape. For a square, all four sides are equal in length, so the formula for the perimeter of a square is Perimeter = 4 × side length. This is because we need to add up all four equal sides: side + side + side + side = 4 × side. For this problem: Perimeter = 4 × 6cm = 24cm. The fundamental principle here is that perimeter measures the boundary of a shape, and for regular polygons (shapes with equal sides), we can multiply the number of sides by the length of one side. Understanding this concept is important for real-world applications like determining how much fencing is needed for a square garden, how much trim is needed for a square room, or how far you would walk around the edge of a square field."

          "text": "1/4"
        }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This problem involves converting a decimal to a fraction, which demonstrates the relationship between different representations of numbers. To convert 0.75 to a fraction, we can recognize that 0.75 means 75 hundredths, or 75/100. This is because the decimal 0.75 has two digits after the decimal point, which represents the hundredths place. To simplify 75/100, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 75 and 100, which is 25. Dividing both numerator and denominator by 25 gives us: 75÷25 / 100÷25 = 3/4. The fundamental principle here is that decimals and fractions are different ways of representing the same value. Decimals represent parts of a whole using powers of 10, while fractions represent parts of a whole as a ratio of two integers. Understanding how to convert between these forms is important for mathematical operations and real-world applications where different forms may be more convenient or required."

          "text": "360°"
        }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This question tests a fundamental theorem in geometry: the sum of interior angles in any triangle is always 180°. This is a proven geometric property that holds true for all triangles, regardless of their shape or size - whether they are equilateral, isosceles, scalene, acute, right, or obtuse triangles. This property can be proven by drawing a line parallel to one side of the triangle through the opposite vertex, which creates alternate interior angles that are equal. When you add up the angles along the straight line, they must equal 180°, which is the same as the sum of the triangle's interior angles. The fundamental principle here is that this is an invariant property of triangles in Euclidean geometry. Understanding this concept is crucial for solving more complex geometric problems and is foundational for trigonometry. This property is used in many real-world applications, such as construction, engineering, and navigation, where triangular structures and relationships are common."

          "text": "4"
        }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This problem involves solving a simple linear equation where the variable is divided by a number. To isolate x, we need to eliminate the division by 4. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4, which is the inverse operation of division. Starting with x/4 = 3, we multiply both sides by 4: (x/4) × 4 = 3 × 4. On the left side, the 4's cancel out, leaving us with x = 12. The fundamental principle here is that to solve for a variable, we need to perform inverse operations to 'undo' what has been done to the variable. Since x was divided by 4, we multiply by 4 to get x by itself. This maintains the equality because we're performing the same operation on both sides of the equation. This concept is essential for solving more complex equations and is a fundamental skill in algebra."

        }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "This question tests your understanding of square roots, which is the inverse operation of squaring a number. The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. In this case, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 64. We can verify that 8 × 8 = 64, so the square root of 64 is 8. The fundamental principle of square roots is that if a² = b, then √b = a (when a is positive). Square roots are important in many mathematical applications, including solving quadratic equations, calculating distances using the Pythagorean theorem, and working with areas of squares. It's helpful to memorize common perfect squares and their square roots, such as 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100, as these appear frequently in mathematical problems."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "This problem involves calculating a percentage of a number, which is a fundamental mathematical skill used in many real-world situations. The word 'percent' means 'per hundred,' so 15% literally means 15 per hundred or 15/100. To find a percentage of a number, we convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply it by the number. To convert 15% to a decimal, we divide by 100: 15% = 15/100 = 0.15. Then we multiply: 0.15 × 200 = 30. The fundamental principle here is that percentages represent parts of a whole, where the whole is considered as 100 parts. Understanding percentages is crucial for applications such as calculating discounts, taxes, interest rates, test scores, and statistical data. An alternative approach is to recognize that 15% = 10% + 5%, so 10% of 200 is 20 and 5% of 200 is 10, giving us 20 + 10 = 30."
